# Loan-Approval-Prediction

Banks consider numerous factors when determining an applicant's loan eligibility. Machine learning models can assist in this process, offering a common application in finance. I developed a loan approval prediction model following these steps:

1. Data Preparation

-Collected historical loan data (approved and denied)
-Cleaned and preprocessed data:
-Handled missing values
-Encoded categorical variables
-Scaled/normalized numerical features

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

-Analyzed dataset structure (rows, columns, data types)
-Examined target variable distribution (loan approval status)
-Visualized data using bar plots, pie charts
-Explored feature distributions using histograms, box plots
-Identified outliers

3. Data Splitting

-Divided data into training and testing sets

4. Model Selection

-Chose algorithms suitable for binary classification:
-Logistic Regression
-Random Forests
-Support Vector Machines
-XGBoost

5. Model Training

-Trained selected models on the training dataset
-Model Evaluation

6. Assessed performance using metrics:
-Accuracy
-Precision
-Recall
-F1-score
-Hyperparameter Tuning
-Optimized model parameters using Grid Search

7. Results

-Achieved 86% accuracy with logistic regression
-Noted potential for improvement through:
Feature engineering

8. Exploring alternative algorithms
This approach provides a structured method for predicting loan approvals, aiding banks in their decision-making process while considering various applicant characteristics.
